# Myntra Clone

This is a clone of the Myntra website, developed as a web project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project simulates a simplified version of an e-commerce website, where users can browse items, filter them by company, and add items to their bag.

## Features

- **Home Page Display**: Items are displayed on the homepage, including details like the image, rating, company name, item name, price, and discount.
- **Add to Bag**: Users can add items to their shopping bag, and the count of items in the bag is dynamically updated.
- **Local Storage**: The bag's content is stored in the browser's local storage, so it persists even after the page is refreshed.
- **Filter by Company**: Users can filter items based on the company name.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that contains the styling for the webpage.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for displaying items, handling the shopping bag, and filtering items.
